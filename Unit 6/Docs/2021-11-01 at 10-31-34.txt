         * and methods from superclass.

         * Shows an "is a" relationship between two classes. 
         *

         * 1. a dog is an Animal
         * 2. a ham and cheese sandwich is a Sandwich
         * 3. a tomato is a Fruit
         * 4. a car is a Vehicle
         * 5. a backpack is a Bag
